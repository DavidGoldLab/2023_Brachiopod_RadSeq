#   Message: 
# There are samples in this assembly that were not present in step 6. This is 
# likely due to failed samples retained in the assembly from prior to step 5, or
# branching/merging. Either branch and remove these samples, or run them through
# step 6. The following samples are not in the step6 database:
# {'C09'}
# Simplest solution is to branch and remove these from the assembly.
